<!-- PLEASE WRITE THE INSTRUCTIONS BETWEEN HERE -->
<p>
    You are now standing at the heart of an advanced rocket launch facility, with a singular mission. An asteroid of catastrophic proportions, designated 99943 Apep, is on a direct collision course with Earth, if it strikes, the devastation will be total - All multicellular life, extinguished.
    Our only hope rests in the successful launch of the Aegis rocket, a kinetic deflection system initially designed to defend against ballistic attacks from hostile nations, it can now be repurposed to defend humanity.
