# To run the safe
# this is for lev/ming/luca/joe
- power on the safe
- once the safe has turned on, and the screen has booted, open the terminal
- enter the command `ls`, this lists all the files.
- then type the command `sh startsafe.sh`, this runs a script to run the safe.
- if this doesnt work, use `cd Documents/safe/safe_cracking/src && python SafeCracking.py`
- wait a few seconds for the safe to boot up. If it is obviously frozen ( nothing typed into the terminal for over 30s + ), you can press `control` + `c` to abort the command.
- once the safe has booted, open a web browser window on the safe.
- navigate to `localhost:5000/resetSafe`
- to start the safe, press the `RESET SAFE` button, this will start the timer
